# Engenharia de Segurança - Project

## Project 1 - Secure software development

### Report

The report should be made available in the space that was made available for your Group on the UC's Github (https://github.com/uminho-miei-engseg-19-20), in a directory with the name "projeto1" by the end of the 23/03/2020.


### Presentation

The oral presentation (30 minutes) in class format will be made in the "UC Engenharia de Segurança" Zoom room (at https://zoom.us/j/970921318?pwd=c3haUDRRWStJYjk1RE9YTnpzVWdJdz09), where the group can share the screen, and the rest of your colleagues can attend (everyone can attend remotely).

This room is active every day from 22/Mar/2020 until the end of the semester, and can be used between 8 am and 10 pm (at least that's what I chose, but I never tried to book for so long - if it has to be changed, you will find on this page the correct link to the room).

Before making the presentation **YOU MUST** try to access the room and understand how you can share the screen, so that you don't waste time with these details during the presentation.


The group will have 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by 5-10 minutes for questions and discussion. At the end of the presentation, the file that served as support (ppt, pdf, ...) must be placed in the "projeto1" directory (see "Report" section).
